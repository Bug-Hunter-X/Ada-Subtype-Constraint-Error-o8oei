This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: exceeding the range of a subtype.  The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to assign a value outside the defined range of the subtype `My_Subtype`, resulting in a `Constraint_Error`. The solution, in `bugSolution.ada`, shows how to prevent this error by performing range checks or using appropriate subtype handling.
